### Pizza Menu

An interactive pizza menu where you can choose between several different sizes as well as many toppings.
When you submit all of your pizza choices, a receipt will be displayed showing all of the options you selected as
well as the total price calculated for your order.

### Calculator

Here is a basic four function working calculator built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

### Dog vs. Bunny

Play my version of tic-tac-toe, "dogs and bunnies", against the computer.  Complete with sound effects and animation!

### PNW page

This one-page website was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used a faux-adventure company as the theme, 
and included my own pictures taken in the Pacific northwest. The page includes an interactive lightbox slideshow, 
embeded videos, and navigation links.

### Travel page

This one-page website was built using bootstrap 4. It includes a jumbotron, cards, badges, and a pop-up form among 
other things. I used a tropical island resort named after my dog Phoenix as the theme. 

### Portfolio Website

This page was built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  It contains a slideshow, popup contact form, navigation links 
within the page, as well as a section with links to my other projects.
